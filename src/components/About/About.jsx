        <p className="pb-10 lg:text-center max-md:text-justify">
        My experience spans web and mobile app development, where I thrive on unraveling code intricacies and constantly honing my skills through exploration and documentation of emerging technologies. I pride myself on being a collaborative team player, known for delivering high-quality work that exceeds expectations. I've contributed to various projects, including developing a Mental Health Chatbot Mobile Application using Flutter, Django, and MongoDB, and crafting a Food Queue Management System using Java. These experiences have not only deepened my understanding of software development but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities.

        <p className="hidden pb-20 lg:text-center max-md:text-justify md:block">
        In addition to technical skills, I'm certified in digital marketing and advertising strategies by Google and LinkedIn. My commitment to continuous learning is evident through my involvement in various extracurricular activities, such as serving as a member of PR & Media at Mozilla Campus Club and volunteering for IEEE. Outside of the tech realm, I indulge in studying geopolitics and refining my soft skills, including leadership, attention to detail, and critical thinking. As a Sri Lankan national fluent in Sinhala, English, Tamil, and Arabic, I bring a diverse perspective to every project I undertake. If you're seeking a motivated and dynamic individual with a passion for technology and a drive to excel, I'd love to connect and explore how we can collaborate on exciting ventures together.
